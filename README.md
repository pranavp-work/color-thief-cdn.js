If you want to extract a dominant color from an image uploaded and identified by an HTML id="" attribute, you can use my GitHub repo to get started. I stumbled upon a particular CDN, a JavaScript library, that can be used to extract the dominant color palette from an image. It works by analyzing the pixels of an image and determining the most representative colors, typically focusing on the dominant ones. This extracted color palette can then be used for various purposes in web development, such as dynamically updating the color scheme of a website to match the colors in a given image. It's often used for creating visually appealing designs and enhancing user experience by providing color harmonies based on images.
